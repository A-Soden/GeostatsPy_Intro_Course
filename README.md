# Introduction to [GeostatsPy](https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPy), Short Course

Introduction to GeostatsPy, an open source Python package for Spatial / Subsurface Data Analytics and Geostatistics

I have included in this repository:

1. the lectures

2. the well-documented and interactive demonstration workflows in Python

3. datasets required for the workflows

#### Course Objectives:

You will gain:
* knowledge concerning basics of the use of the GeostatsPy package for spatial/subsurface data analytics and geostatistics. 

* experience with a variety of practical spatial data analytics / geostatistics workflows in Python

#### Course Agenda
* Introduction: objectives, plan
* Variogram Calculation - quantifying spatial continuity
* Variogram Modeling - formulating valide spatial continuity models
* Kriging - spatial estimation
* Conclusions

#### Getting Started

Here's the steps to get setup in Python with the GeostatsPy package:

1. Install [Anaconda 3](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). 
2. From Anaconda Navigator (within Anaconda3 group), go to the environment tab, click on base (root) green arrow and open a terminal. 
3. In the terminal type: pip install geostatspy. 
4. Open Jupyter Notebook and in the top block get started by copy and pasting the code block below from this Jupyter Notebook to start using the geostatspy functionality. 

```python
import geostatspy.GSLIB as GSLIB
import geostatspy.geostats as geostats
```

You will need to copy the data file to your working directory.  They are available here:

* Tabular data - sample_data.csv at https://git.io/fh4gm.

There are exampled below with these functions. You can go here to see a list of the available functions, https://git.io/fh4eX, other example workflows and source code.

#### Want to Work Together?

I hope that this is helpful to those that want to learn more about subsurface modeling, data analytics and machine learning. Students and working professionals are welcome to participate.

* Want to invite me to visit your company for training, mentoring, project review, workflow design and consulting, I'd be happy to drop by and work with you! 

* Interested in partnering, supporting my graduate student research or my Subsurface Data Analytics and Machine Learning consortium (co-PIs including Profs. Foster, Torres-Verdin and van Oort)? My research combines data analytics, stochastic modeling and machine learning theory with practice to develop novel methods and workflows to add value. We are solving challenging subsurface problems!

I'm always happy to discuss,

*Michael*
